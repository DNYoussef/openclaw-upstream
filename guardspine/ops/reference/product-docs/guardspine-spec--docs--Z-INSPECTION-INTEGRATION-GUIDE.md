## Executive Summary

Z-Inspection is a 9-step, 3-phase process for assessing trustworthy AI, developed under the EU High-Level Expert Group framework. It maps findings to the 7 ALTAI requirements. GuardSpine generates cryptographically sealed evidence bundles for AI-mediated code changes. The integration thesis: GuardSpine can automate evidence generation for 4 of the 7 ALTAI requirements, converting Z-Inspection from point-in-time manual audits to continuous machine-verifiable evidence trails.

## Part 1: Z-Inspection Process Overview

### The 3 Phases, 9 Steps

```
PHASE 1: SET UP
  Step 1: Pre-conditions verification (legal admissibility, conflict of interest)
  Step 2: Team formation (multidisciplinary experts)
  Step 3: Protocol documentation (log of inspection process over time)
  Step 4: Boundary definition (scope of assessment)

PHASE 2: ASSESS
  Step 5: Socio-technical scenario analysis (actors, expectations, processes, tech, context)
  Step 6: Ethical issue identification (consensus building among stakeholders)
  Step 7: Trustworthy AI mapping (map issues to EU 7 ALTAI requirements)

PHASE 3: RESOLVE
  Step 8: Execution (define paths, perform inspection, provide feedback)
  Step 9: Resolution & maintenance (address tensions, recommend, ethical maintenance)
```

### Current Pain Points in Z-Inspection

1. **Manual evidence gathering**: Assessors collect screenshots, meeting notes, spreadsheets
2. **Point-in-time snapshots**: Assessment happens once, not continuously
3. **No tamper evidence**: Documents can be modified after assessment
4. **Mapping is subjective**: Mapping issues to ALTAI requirements is consensus-based, not machine-verifiable
5. **No retention infrastructure**: Assessment artifacts scattered across tools

## Part 2: GuardSpine Evidence Bundle Schema (v0.2.1)

### Top-Level Structure

```json
{
  "bundle_id": "UUID v4",
  "version": "0.2.1",
  "created_at": "ISO 8601 timestamp",
  "policy_id": "reference to rubric used",
  "artifact_id": "what was assessed (e.g., github:org/repo/file)",
  "risk_tier": "L0|L1|L2|L3|L4",
  "items": [ "ordered evidence items" ],
  "immutability_proof": { "hash_chain": [], "root_hash": "sha256:..." },
  "signatures": [ "cryptographic signatures" ],
  "sanitization": { "PII-Shield attestation" },
  "metadata": { "extensible key-value" }
}
```

### Evidence Item Types

| content_type             | Purpose                  | Fields                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `diff`                   | Code change snapshot     | hunks, line-level changes, from/to hashes, stats                |
| `policy_evaluation`      | Policy check results     | policy_id, policy_version, result (pass/fail), findings[]       |
| `approval`               | Human/AI decision record | approver (id, type, name, org), decision, rationale, conditions |
| `guardspine/audit_event` | System-level event       | event_type, message, details                                    |
| `guardspine/test-result` | Test execution evidence  | test results, pass/fail                                         |

### Immutability Proof

Each item gets a hash chain link: `chain_hash = SHA-256(sequence | item_id | content_type | content_hash | previous_hash)`. The root_hash covers all chain_hash values. Any modification to any item invalidates the chain.

### Signature Support

Algorithms: Ed25519, RSA-SHA256, ECDSA-P256, HMAC-SHA256. Each signature records: signer_id, signer_type (human/ai_model/system), signed_at timestamp, public_key_id reference.

### Sanitization Attestation (v0.2.1)

PII-Shield integration records: engine, method (deterministic_hmac), redaction counts by type, input/output hashes, which pipeline stages were sanitized.

## Part 3: Requirement-Level Mapping

### Mapping Legend

| Coverage | Meaning                                                            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| STRONG   | Direct evidence bundle fields address this requirement             |
| MODERATE | Partial coverage; bundle fields contribute but don't fully satisfy |
| WEAK     | Tangential connection; not a primary design goal                   |
| GAP      | No current coverage; integration opportunity                       |

---

### Requirement 4: Transparency (STRONG)

This is GuardSpine's primary strength relative to Z-Inspection.

#### 4.1 Traceability

ALTAI asks: Can the decisions and actions of the AI system be traced back? Are the datasets, processes, and decisions documented?

| ALTAI Sub-question          | GuardSpine Evidence                                         | Bundle Field                             |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Can AI decisions be traced? | Every event in the PR lifecycle is recorded with timestamps | `items[].created_at`, `items[].sequence` |
| Are datasets documented?    | The exact diff (code change) is captured at analysis time   | `items[content_type=diff].content.hunks` |
| Are processes documented?   | Hash chain proves the order and integrity of all steps      | `immutability_proof.hash_chain[]`        |
| Is there a decision log?    | Full audit trail with actor identity and action type        | `audit_trail.entries[]`                  |
| Can outcomes be reproduced? | Content hashes are deterministic (same input = same hash)   | `items[].content_hash`                   |

#### 4.2 Explainability

ALTAI asks: Can the AI system's decisions be explained? Is the logic transparent?

| ALTAI Sub-question               | GuardSpine Evidence                               | Bundle Field                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Why was this risk tier assigned? | Policy evaluation findings explain classification | `items[content_type=policy_evaluation].content.findings[]` |
| What assertion is being made?    | Scope block contains the assertion text           | `scope.assertion_text`                                     |
| Why was this approved/rejected?  | Approver records include written rationale        | `items[content_type=approval].content.rationale`           |
| What conditions were set?        | Conditional approvals are recorded                | `items[content_type=approval].content.conditions[]`        |

#### 4.3 Communication

ALTAI asks: Are users informed about the AI system's capabilities and limitations?

| ALTAI Sub-question                           | GuardSpine Evidence                                    | Bundle Field                             |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Are stakeholders informed of AI involvement? | Diff Postcard PR comment shows risk tier + AI findings | CodeGuard PR comment output              |
| Are findings accessible?                     | SARIF export feeds GitHub Security Tab                 | `upload_sarif` output                    |
| Are limitations communicated?                | Multi-model agreement score shows confidence level     | `agreement_score`, `dissenting_opinions` |

---

### Requirement 7: Accountability (STRONG)

#### 7.1 Auditability

ALTAI asks: Can the AI system be audited by independent third parties? Are there mechanisms for logging?

| ALTAI Sub-question                   | GuardSpine Evidence                                                                           | Bundle Field                                           |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Can independent third parties audit? | Bundle is a standalone JSON file; guardspine-verify works offline with zero vendor dependency | `immutability_proof.root_hash` + guardspine-verify CLI |
| Are there logging mechanisms?        | Every action is timestamped, identified, and hash-chained                                     | `audit_trail.entries[]`                                |
| Is there tamper detection?           | SHA-256 hash chain; any modification invalidates the chain                                    | `immutability_proof.hash_chain[]`, `root_hash`         |
| Who made decisions?                  | Signatures identify signers (human, AI, system) with timestamps                               | `signatures[].signer_id`, `signer_type`, `signed_at`   |
| Are bundles retained?                | Configurable retention (up to 7+ years for compliance)                                        | `retention.retention_days`, `retention.policy`         |

#### 7.2 Minimization and Reporting of Negative Impact

| ALTAI Sub-question                 | GuardSpine Evidence                                     | Bundle Field                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Are risks identified and reported? | Policy evaluation findings flag issues by severity      | `items[content_type=policy_evaluation].content.findings[].severity` |
| Are high-risk actions blocked?     | L3/L4 changes require human approval; can block merge   | `risk_tier`, `requires_approval`, `fail_on_high_risk`               |
| Is there multi-perspective review? | 2-3 AI models review L2+ changes with consensus scoring | `models_used`, `consensus_risk`, `agreement_score`                  |

#### 7.3 Trade-offs

| ALTAI Sub-question                  | GuardSpine Evidence                        | Bundle Field                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Are trade-offs documented?          | Model disagreements are tracked separately | `dissenting_opinions`                               |
| Are conditional decisions recorded? | Approvals can include conditions           | `items[content_type=approval].content.conditions[]` |

#### 7.4 Redress

| ALTAI Sub-question                       | GuardSpine Evidence                                                                 | Bundle Field            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Can past decisions be revisited?         | Bundles are retained per compliance policy                                          | `retention{}`           |
| Can the decision chain be reconstructed? | Full audit trail preserved                                                          | `audit_trail.entries[]` |
| Can claims be independently verified?    | guardspine-verify: `pip install guardspine-verify && guardspine-verify bundle.json` | Standalone tool         |

---

### Requirement 1: Human Agency & Oversight (STRONG)

#### 1.1 Human Agency

| ALTAI Sub-question                              | GuardSpine Evidence                                                    | Bundle Field                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Do humans retain meaningful decision authority? | L3/L4 changes REQUIRE human approval; AI recommends but doesn't decide | `items[content_type=approval].content.approver.signer_type = "human"` |
| Can humans override AI recommendations?         | Humans can approve despite AI concerns, or reject despite AI approval  | `approval.decision` vs `consensus_risk`                               |

#### 1.2 Human Oversight

| ALTAI Sub-question                            | GuardSpine Evidence                                         | Bundle Field                                        |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --- | --- |
| Is there human-in-the-loop?                   | L4 (Critical) = mandatory HUMAN approval                    | `risk_threshold` config, `requires_approval`        |
| Can oversight level be configured?            | risk_threshold is configurable per branch/repo              | `risk_threshold: L2                                 | L3  | L4` |
| Is the human oversight proportionate to risk? | Tier-based escalation: L0 = no review, L4 = mandatory human | `risk_tier` -> `models_used` -> `requires_approval` |

---

### Requirement 3: Privacy & Data Governance (STRONG via PII-Shield)

#### 3.1 Privacy

| ALTAI Sub-question                    | GuardSpine Evidence                                                                | Bundle Field                                                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Is personal data protected?           | PII-Shield detects secrets and PII via entropy analysis, replaces with HMAC tokens | `sanitization.engine_name`, `sanitization.method`                           |
| Is sanitization documented?           | Sanitization attestation records what was redacted                                 | `sanitization.redaction_count`, `sanitization.redactions_by_type`           |
| Is sanitization applied consistently? | Same salt = same HMAC token across all bundles                                     | `sanitization.salt_fingerprint`                                             |
| What pipeline stages are protected?   | Tracks which outputs were sanitized                                                | `sanitization.applied_to[]` (ai_prompt, pr_comment, evidence_bundle, sarif) |

#### 3.2 Data Quality & Integrity

| ALTAI Sub-question                 | GuardSpine Evidence                          | Bundle Field                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Is data integrity ensured?         | Every content item is SHA-256 hashed         | `items[].content_hash`                                |
| Can data modification be detected? | Hash chain detects any post-creation changes | `immutability_proof`                                  |
| Is pre/post sanitization tracked?  | Input and output hashes recorded             | `sanitization.input_hash`, `sanitization.output_hash` |

---

### Requirement 2: Technical Robustness & Safety (MODERATE)

#### 2.1 Resilience to Attack and Security

| ALTAI Sub-question                         | GuardSpine Evidence                           | Bundle Field                         |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Is the system resistant to tampering?      | SHA-256 hash chains, cryptographic signatures | `immutability_proof`, `signatures[]` |
| Are multiple signing algorithms supported? | Ed25519, RSA-SHA256, ECDSA-P256, HMAC-SHA256  | `signatures[].algorithm`             |

#### 2.2 Accuracy

| ALTAI Sub-question               | GuardSpine Evidence                               | Bundle Field                     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Is the AI's assessment accurate? | Multi-model consensus reduces single-model errors | `models_used`, `agreement_score` |
| Is the assessment structured?    | Rubric scoring provides quantified evaluation     | Rubric-based policy evaluation   |

#### 2.3 Reliability and Reproducibility

| ALTAI Sub-question         | GuardSpine Evidence                                        | Bundle Field                                    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Can results be reproduced? | Deterministic hashing: same content = same hash every time | `content_hash = sha256(canonicalJSON(content))` |
| Is the spec versioned?     | Schema version tracked in every bundle                     | `version: "0.2.1"`                              |

---

### Requirement 5: Diversity, Non-discrimination & Fairness (WEAK)

| ALTAI Sub-question             | GuardSpine Evidence                                                                        | Coverage                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Is there bias in AI decisions? | Multi-model review (diverse providers/architectures) reduces single-model bias             | WEAK - diversity of models, not diversity of human perspectives |
| Is the system accessible?      | Open source (MIT), standard JSON format, multiple verification methods (CLI, Docker, PyPI) | MODERATE - technical accessibility, not universal design        |

**Gap**: GuardSpine does not currently assess code changes for discriminatory impact or fairness of AI outputs. A Z-Inspection rubric could add fairness-specific findings.

---

### Requirement 6: Societal & Environmental Well-being (WEAK)

| ALTAI Sub-question                  | GuardSpine Evidence                                                              | Coverage                          |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Is environmental impact considered? | Ollama local mode reduces cloud compute; models_used tracks resource consumption | WEAK                              |
| Is social impact assessed?          | Risk tier prevents unchecked AI-generated code from shipping to production       | WEAK - indirect social protection |

**Gap**: GuardSpine does not measure carbon footprint, social impact, or democratic implications. These remain manual Z-Inspection assessment areas.

## Part 4: Z-Inspection Process Step Mapping

How GuardSpine artifacts support each Z-Inspection step:

| Z-Inspection Step               | GuardSpine Support                                                                                                      | Coverage |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 1. Pre-conditions               | `metadata{}` can store pre-condition checks; `policy_id` references governance framework                                | MODERATE |
| 2. Team formation               | `signatures[].signer_id` identifies team members; `approver{}` records human reviewers                                  | STRONG   |
| 3. Protocol documentation       | **The entire bundle IS the protocol.** Hash-chained, timestamped, signed event log.                                     | STRONG   |
| 4. Boundary definition          | `scope{}` with artifact_id, version_from/to, assertion_type; `risk_tier` defines severity boundary                      | STRONG   |
| 5. Socio-technical scenarios    | `items[content_type=diff]` shows technical change; `policy_evaluation` shows policy context; `risk_drivers` show impact | MODERATE |
| 6. Ethical issue identification | `items[content_type=policy_evaluation].findings[]` identify issues; rubric evaluation applies compliance frameworks     | MODERATE |
| 7. Trustworthy AI mapping       | **KEY GAP.** GuardSpine maps to SOC2/HIPAA/PCI-DSS but NOT to ALTAI 7 requirements.                                     | GAP      |
| 8. Execution                    | CodeGuard GitHub Action runs automatically on every PR - continuous execution                                           | STRONG   |
| 9. Resolution & maintenance     | `approval` items with decision/rationale/conditions; `retention{}` for long-term maintenance                            | STRONG   |

  "metadata": {
    "z_inspection": {
      "assessment_id": "ZI-2026-0042",
      "phase": "assess",
      "step": 7,
      "assessor_team": ["ishwar.chavhan", "david.youssef"],
      "altai_coverage": {
        "transparency": { "status": "evidenced", "items": ["item-001", "item-002", "item-003"] },
        "accountability": { "status": "evidenced", "items": ["item-001", "item-003"] },
        "human_oversight": { "status": "evidenced", "items": ["item-003"] },
        "privacy": { "status": "evidenced", "items": ["sanitization"] },

    },
    "retention": {
      "policy": "regulatory",
      "retention_days": 2555
    }
  }
}
```

## Part 6: Coverage Summary

### ALTAI Requirements Coverage Matrix

| #   | ALTAI Requirement             | Coverage | Automated? | GuardSpine Evidence                                |
| --- | ----------------------------- | -------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Human Agency & Oversight      | STRONG   | Yes        | Tier-based human approval, override capability     |
| 2   | Technical Robustness & Safety | MODERATE | Yes        | Hash chains, multi-model consensus, signatures     |
| 3   | Privacy & Data Governance     | STRONG   | Yes        | PII-Shield sanitization, integrity proofs          |
| 4   | Transparency                  | STRONG   | Yes        | Hash-chained event log, findings, rationale        |
| 5   | Diversity & Fairness          | WEAK     | No         | Multi-model diversity only; no fairness assessment |
| 6   | Societal Well-being           | WEAK     | No         | Indirect only (risk gating)                        |
| 7   | Accountability                | STRONG   | Yes        | Tamper-evident audit trail, offline verification   |

**Result**: 4 of 7 requirements have STRONG automated coverage. 1 has MODERATE. 2 require manual Z-Inspection assessment (fairness, societal impact).

### Z-Inspection Process Step Coverage

| Phase         | Steps Covered | Steps Partially Covered | Gaps                            |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Set Up (1-4)  | 2, 3, 4       | 1                       | None significant                |
| Assess (5-7)  | -             | 5, 6                    | 7 (ALTAI mapping rubric needed) |
| Resolve (8-9) | 8, 9          | -                       | None                            |

## Part 7: Open Questions for Ishwar

1. **Rubric structure**: Does the proposed `z-inspection.yaml` rubric align with how Z-Inspection assessors actually work? Should it be organized differently?

2. **Evidence sufficiency**: For each ALTAI requirement marked STRONG, would a Z-Inspection assessor accept an evidence bundle as sufficient documentation, or would they need additional manual artifacts?

3. **Phase tracking**: Is the proposed `z_inspection` metadata extension useful? Should it track more granular phase state?

4. **Ethical tensions**: Z-Inspection identifies "ethical tensions" in Step 6. Could these be represented as a new evidence item type (`content_type: "ethical_tension"`) with fields for the tension description, stakeholders affected, and proposed resolution?

5. **Continuous vs point-in-time**: Z-Inspection is designed as a point-in-time assessment. If GuardSpine produces evidence bundles on every PR, how should Z-Inspection adapt? Periodic sampling? Aggregate reports? Dashboard?

6. **ALTAI question coverage**: The ALTAI checklist has 100+ specific questions. Which subset is most relevant to AI-mediated code changes specifically (vs. broader AI system assessment)?

7. **Requirements 5 & 6**: What would a fairness and societal impact assessment look like for a code governance tool? Is there a meaningful way to automate any portion?
