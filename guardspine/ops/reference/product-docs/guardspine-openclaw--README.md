# guardspine-openclaw

OpenClaw integration plugin for [GuardSpine](https://github.com/DNYoussef/GuardSpine) - the unified governance and evidence system for AI-assisted work.

This plugin brings GuardSpine's deny-by-default governance to [OpenClaw](https://github.com/nickarora/openclaw) agents. Gates every tool call through L0-L4 risk tiers with hash-chained evidence packs, a 3-model local council, and remote human approval.

## The Problem

AI agents with tool access (shell, files, network) need governance that scales with risk. A greeting should flow freely. A `rm -rf` should require multi-model review. A credential change should require human sign-off. This plugin resolves the tension between autonomy and oversight by gating on risk and blast radius.

## Risk Tiers

| Tier   | Gate            | Example Tools                         | Latency |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------- |
| **L0** | No-op           | `sequentialthinking`, `memory_search` | 0ms     |
| **L1** | Log only        | `rlm_read`, `web_search`              | <1ms    |
| **L2** | Evidence pack   | `bash`, `apply_patch`, `send_message` | <1ms    |
| **L3** | 3-model council | `rm -rf`, `curl`, `npm install`       | 30-60s  |
| **L4** | Council + human | `credential_access`, `chmod 777`      | Manual  |

Bash commands are dynamically escalated based on content (regex pattern matching on destructive/network/credential patterns).

## Install

```bash
# Clone into OpenClaw extensions
cd ~/.openclaw/extensions
git clone https://github.com/DNYoussef/guardspine-openclaw guardspine

# Add to openclaw.json
# Under "plugins": add "guardspine"
```

### Requirements

- **OpenClaw** v2026.1.x+
- **Ollama** running locally (for L3 council)
- **3 models pulled** (6GB+ VRAM, runs sequentially):

```bash
ollama pull qwen3:8b
ollama pull falcon3:7b
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b
```

### Configuration

In `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`, add under `plugins`:

```json
{
  "guardspine": {
    "enforcement_mode": "audit",
    "council_endpoint": "http://localhost:11434"
  }
}
```

Modes:

- `audit` - Log all decisions, block nothing (start here)
- `enforce` - Active gating with council and approval
- `disabled` - Plugin loaded but inactive

## How It Works

### Evidence Packs

Every L2+ tool call produces a SHA-256 hash-chained evidence entry. At session end, the full pack is written to `~/.openclaw/guardspine-logs/evidence-pack-{session}.json`. Each entry links to the previous via `chain_hash`, making the audit trail tamper-evident.

### L3 Council

Three Ollama models run sequentially (VRAM-safe, one at a time with unload between):

| Auditor | Model              | Weight | Role               |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------ | ------------------ |
| A       | `qwen3:8b`         | 0.40   | Primary Evaluator  |
| B       | `falcon3:7b`       | 0.35   | Technical Verifier |
| C       | `qwen2.5-coder:7b` | 0.25   | Code Auditor       |

Each scores 5 dimensions (0-5): prompt injection resistance, blast radius, reversibility, secrets exposure, intent clarity. Aggregation is deterministic: any FAIL = FAIL, any ESCALATE = ESCALATE, 2+ PASS = PASS.

### L4 Approval (Discord + file fallback)

When a tool call hits L4, the plugin:

1. **Sends a Discord DM** to the configured approver via OpenClaw's runtime API (`sendMessageDiscord`)
2. **Writes a file** to `~/.openclaw/guardspine-logs/dev_inbox/` as fallback
3. **Polls for 5 minutes** (10s intervals) checking both the `guardspine_approve` tool and the dev_inbox file

Approve via Discord: `/approve <id> allow-once` or use the `guardspine_approve` tool.

Configure the Discord target in `openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "guardspine": {
        "discord_approval_target": "user:YOUR_DISCORD_USER_ID"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
